# Mining-Bots
Mining Bots that i've made in Python 

- I've made 'MiningBTCbot.py' for mining btc by their hashes.

- 'TradingCryptoBOT.py' was made with the binance library, so the user can interact with bases function of binance by the terminal in a simple way.

- 'DiscordMiningBot' is connect with a discord server that i've made (is possible that when you're reading this message the server is turn off). Is important download the 'file.py' with the 'target_price.txt' because is there that the bot save the price that you set.
